# 🌐 Web Scraping Project – API Data Extraction with Pagination using BeautifulSoup

## 📌 Overview
This project is designed to fetch data from an open-source API using web scraping techniques. It processes the response, handles pagination to retrieve complete datasets, and stores the extracted data in a structured format.

The implementation uses Python along with BeautifulSoup and related libraries to parse and manage the data efficiently.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Extract data from open-source API
- Implement **pagination logic** to fetch complete datasets
- Parse and clean data using **BeautifulSoup**
- Store output data locally
- Logging and error handling
- Modular project structure

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup (bs4)
- Pandas (optional)
- JSON / CSV

---

## 🔄 How It Works
1. API details are defined in `config.py`
2. The main script (`main.py`) triggers the scraping process
3. Data is fetched using API requests
4. Pagination is applied to loop through all available pages
5. Response is parsed using BeautifulSoup
6. Cleaned data is stored in the `data/` folder
7. Logs are maintained in the `logs/` directory

---

## 🔁 Pagination Logic
- Iterates through pages using page number or next token
- Stops when no more data is available
- Ensures complete and non-duplicate data extraction

---

## 📊 Output
- Data is stored in:
  - CSV format
  - JSON format

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping-project.git
cd web-scraping-project

### 2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Run the Project
python main.py

---

## ⚙️ Configuration
Update API details in:
config.py

Example:
```python
BASE_URL = "https://api.example.com/data"
PARAMS = {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 50
}

## ❗ Error Handling
- Handles failed API calls  
- Logs errors in `logs/` directory  
- Skips invalid or empty responses  

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Add scheduling (Cron / Airflow)  
- Store data in database  
- Implement incremental data loading  
- Integrate with data pipelines
